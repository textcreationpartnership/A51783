            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>To the Right Honourable Sir JOHN SOMMERS, Kt. Lord Keeper of the Great Seal of ENGLAND, and one of His Majeſties Moſt Honourable Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Council.</head>
            <p>AMongſt the pious acknowledgements, which have been lately paid to the Memory of our late Queen, This comes, tho' leſs deſerving, to crave your Lordſhips Patronage. The true concern of its Author, will, I hope, in ſome ſort excuſe the errors of the Poem. 'Tis Paſtoral, my Lord: A kind of Verſe, us'd amongſt Shepherds in old time, that admits of nothing affected, or diſagreeing to the pureſt Innocence, ſuch as was practiſed in the Golden Age. I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume not hereby to inform your Lordſhip of the Nature of Paſtorals, but to vindicate that Verſe from the ill opinions of ſome, who, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, by diſapproving of it, muſt be no Friends to Virtue and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence. But leaſt I prove troubleſome to your Lordſhip, whoſe Hours are of infinite Value and Importance, I humbly begg your Lordſhips acceptance of this Eſſay, and the Honour to ſubſcribe my ſelf,</p>

               <l>To make, which well deſerves a Faithul hand.</l>
               <l>I know thee grateful, and of tender mind,</l>
               <l>Ready to pleaſe, and moulded to be kind.</l>
               <l>You well recall how at <hi>Adonis</hi> Feaſt,</l>
               <l>Amongſt the tuneful Swains, at your requeſt,</l>
               <l>At your requeſt, tho' much unskill'd in Lays,</l>
               <l>I play'd upon my Pipe, and ſung my <hi>Damon</hi>'s praiſe.</l>
               <l>Shepherd, I piped, and ſung with all my Might,</l>
               <l>Becauſe 'twas pleaſing in my Shepherds ſight.</l>
               <l>Now all I ask is, Grant me one ſoft hour,</l>
               <l>Soft as <hi>Aglae</hi>'s Arms, in yonder Bower:</l>
               <l>An unfrequented place, ſecure of ſhade,</l>
               <l>Fertile in wilds, for Grief moſt fitly made.</l>

               <l>For ſo exalted doth the Theme appear,</l>

               <l>Beſides, ſhould I retire with thee and ſing,</l>
               <l>My Flocks would ſtray to the forbidden Spring:</l>

Such faults all thereabouts are lately ſeen,</l>
               <l>That now my Sheep graze always on the Green.</l>
               <l>Yet to oblige the Swain, my gentle Friend,</l>

               <l>To ſing great, lofty ſtrains, in Roman ſhade;</l>
               <l>A Shepherd's humble Verſe is full as well,</l>
               <l>To ſhew a true concern, and tender zeal.</l>
